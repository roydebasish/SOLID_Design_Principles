 *SOLID Principles -
 * SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (ODD)
 * principles by Robert C. Martin
 * ---
 * S -> Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have one and only one reason to change.
 * O -> Open Closed Principle - Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 * L -> Liskov Substitution Principle - Objects of super class shall be replaced with objects of subclasses.
 * I -> Interface Segregation Principle - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.
 * D -> Dependency Inversion Principle - High level modules should not directly depend on low level modules,instead they should depend on abstraction.
